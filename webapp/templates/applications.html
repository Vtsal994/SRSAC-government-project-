            <h4>Overview of Space Technology Applications in Rajasthan</h4>
            <p>
              Space technology, encompassing Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), plays a crucial role in providing essential information for the sustainable management of resources and supporting various developmental activities across different departments in Rajasthan. [4, 10] It offers synoptic views of large areas, repetitive coverage, and multi-spectral data with variable resolution, making it an indispensable tool for planners and administrators. [10, 12]
            </p>
            <p>
              The applications span multiple sectors, including agriculture, forestry, environment, land and water resources, rural and urban development, mining, transport, infrastructure, and more. [13] Common uses involve mapping for monitoring, tracing, measuring, assessment, identification, and modeling, contributing significantly to informed decision-making and efficient resource management. [13]
            </p>
          </section>

            <h4>2.1 Agriculture/Horticulture Department</h4>
            <p>
              Remote sensing technology is extensively used in agriculture for monitoring seasonal patterns of crops, assessing productivity, and managing variable climatic conditions. [16] It provides timely information crucial for agricultural planning, drought declaration, and crop forecasting. [16] Applications include land use, crop type identification, yield prediction, soil type mapping, and estimation of crop water requirements, among others. [16]
            </p>
            <p>
              SRSAC has been vital in assisting agricultural policy decisions by providing timely statistics on crop production and forecasting. [17] Key projects include the "Crop Acreage and Production Estimation (CAPE)" in collaboration with Space Applications Centre (SAC) and ISRO, which estimated wheat and mustard acreage across various districts from 1989 onwards. [17] The Centre also contributed to the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD) and projects for estimating crop residue burned areas and generating soil fertility maps across Rajasthan. [17] Currently, SRSAC supports the FASAL project by providing ground-based data for crop acreage estimation. [17]

              Geospatial technology is widely used globally for environmental data analysis and planning, enabling the derivation of various environmental parameters from remote sensing data. [21] It aids in preventing environmental hazards, monitoring, and mitigation, and is also used for generating environmental models, air pollution control, disaster management, and wastewater management.

            <ul>
              <li>SRSAC prepared inputs for environmental studies for Sanganer, submitted to the National Productivity Council (NPC), New Delhi. [21]</li>
              <li>Basemap and LULC maps were prepared for the proposed Power Generating Plant at Mahi, Banswara, submitted to Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL). [21]</li>
              <li>Land Use Land Cover Analysis was conducted for areas around Kasnau-Matasukh Mines (Nagaur), Kayad Mines (Ajmer), and Barsingsar Mines (Bikaner). [21]</li>

            <h5>Current Work:</h5>
            <p>
              Wetlands mapping is an ongoing critical environmental project, with a state-wide wetland inventory being created in collaboration with ISRO, producing remote sensing-based mapping products for 100 selected wetlands in Rajasthan. [21] Following the successful green-cover assessment for Chanderiya Lead Zinc Smelter, Hindustan Zinc Ltd. has commissioned SRSAC to assess green-cover for seven more sites using very high-resolution satellite images.

            <p>
              SRSAC intends to apply geospatial technology for various environmental mapping tasks, especially with rising concerns about climate change and its impact on crop production.
