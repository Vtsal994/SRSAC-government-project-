          <section id="intro">
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The <strong>State Remote Sensing Application Centre (SRSAC), Jodhpur</strong>, was established in 1985 by
              the Department of Science & Technology, Government of Rajasthan. Initially, it operated as the Aerial Photo Interpretation Laboratory (APIL) under the Desert Development Programme (1979), with the aim to assist soil and water conservation planning in the State, under the State Agriculture Department. In 1985, recognizing the multi-disciplinary utilities of Remote Sensing technology, the laboratory was transferred to the State Department of Science & Technology and officially renamed as State Remote Sensing Application Centre (SRSAC).
            </p>
            <p>
              SRSAC functions as the geospatial hub for Rajasthan, providing spatial planning, monitoring, and decision-making solutions through geoinformatics to various state departments. The Centre has been instrumental in utilizing remote sensing and GIS technologies for sustainable development in Rajasthan, collaborating extensively with national agencies like the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Space, Government of India. [4] It has contributed to projects such as land-use-land-cover mapping, crop-forecasting, acreage estimation, wetland mapping, wasteland mapping, groundwater prospects, and groundwater quality mapping.
